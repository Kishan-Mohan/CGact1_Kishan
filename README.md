Kishan Mohanakanth(100921637)_Computer Graphics In-class Activity 1
2025-09-19

This Unity project was created for the shaders fundamentals activity. The goal was to explore different shaders for the 3D mesh, textures, and world data. Four shaders were implemented: MultiUV shader, View Direction shader, World Position shader, and World Reflection shader. These shaders demonstrate how textures, world space math and environment reflections change how surfaces are rendered in Unity. 
MultiUV Shader: Has a drop down UV0 and UV1, demonstrates how meshes with multiple UVs can switch between texture mappings 
ViewDir Shader: computes surface direction in world space, adds rim lighting controlled by color, power, and strength sliders. 
WorldPos Shader: passes the world position to the shader, converts coordinates into a repeating colourful grid.
WorldReflection Shader: implements environment reflections using cubemaps, computes reflection vectors from view direction and surface normals. 

Some strengths I gained from this activity is getting hands-on experience with Unlit shaders in unity URP, learning and programming each line of code. Learning what each shader does on the 3D mesh. Some weaknesses I faced during this activity is the process of trial and error when coding the shader, the beginning phase of learning to make shaders. Some opportunities I have identified through the activity are to combine the main texture and different effects/mess around with different effects into a single unlit shader.
